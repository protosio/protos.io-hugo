# Download Protos

Protos has two components, the server component, `protosd`, and the desktop `cli` client. In the future GUI based desktop clients will be provided.
A user only needs to download and install the `cli`, which takes care of deploying the server component to one of the supported cloud providers. 64bit binaries only are distributed
at the moment.

##### CLI

This page contains only the latest `cli` release, which is `0.0.0-dev.1`

 * macOS - [protos-cli_0.0.0-dev.1_darwin](https://releases.protos.io/cli/0.0.0-dev.1/protos-cli_0.0.0-dev.1_darwin)
 * Linux - [protos-cli_0.0.0-dev.1_linux](https://releases.protos.io/cli/0.0.0-dev.1/protos-cli_0.0.0-dev.1_linux)
 * Windows - [protos-cli_0.0.0-dev.1_windows](https://releases.protos.io/cli/0.0.0-dev.1/protos-cli_0.0.0-dev.1_windows)

##### Server ISO

The Protos server component, `protosd`, is released as an ISO image for each supported cloud provider. While this should not be used directly,
the server releases can be found [here](https://releases.protos.io).
